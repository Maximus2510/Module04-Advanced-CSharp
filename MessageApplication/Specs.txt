Module #4: Advanced C#
Task 1
- Create a console application.
- The application will provide the following functionality:
    - Create message.
        - Messages have an id, title, body, an importance.
        - Ids are auto-incremental.
        - Importance can be low, medium, high.
            - Use an Enumeration.
    - List all created messages on the console.
        - The list of messages is it's own type.
        - Use generic types to store the messages.
        - The list of messages returns an IEnumerable.
    - Delete message by id.
        - Deleting a message does not affect the ids of the existing messages.
    - Create recipient.
        - Recipients have id, name, email, and phone number.
        - Ids are auto-incremental.
    - List all created recipients on the console.
        - The list of recipients is it's own type.
        - Use generic types to store the recipients.
        - The list of recipients returns an IEnumerable.
    - Delete recipient by id.
        - Deleting a recipient does not affect the ids of the existing recipients.
    - Send message by Id to recipient.
        - The user specifies the message id and the recipient id.
    - Send all messages to recipient.
        - The user specifies the recipient id.
    - Exit the application.
    - The send message funcionality always require the user to specify if it is via Email or SMS.
        - Using an interface is a must.
        - Sending the messages will be simulated by displaying the information in the console.
        - Sending an SMS will display:
            - "Sending SMS to: " and concatenate the recipient's name. (String interpolation could be implemented).
            - Then the recipient phone number and the message body.
        - Sending an Email will display:
            - "Sending Email to: " and concatenate the recipient's name. (String interpolation could be implemented).
            - Then the recipient email address, the message title, the message importance, and the message body.
- The application will be constantly listening for commands.
- The application must handle exceptions and recover from errors


Task 2
- The application will provide the following funtionality:
    - List all messages by importance.
        - The user specifies the desired importance level.
        - Using extension methods to filter the messages is a must.
    - Send messages by importance to recipient.
        - The user specifies the importance level.
        - The user specifies the recipient id.
- The application will now support sending messages as notifications.
    - Using the same interface is a must.
    - Sending a notification will display:
        - "Sending Notification to: " and concatenate the recipient's name. (String interpolation could be implemented).
        - Then recipient phone number, the message title, the message importance, and the message body.
